Dubstep Remixer - You input a song and you get a track editer. You can
then take segments of the song and add effects to them. This would
allow everyone to simply write their own effects that you could put on 
a song. This would be difficult though because you'd have to learn how to 
use all the sound api.
Games - Simple stuff like TicTacToe or Connect 4.  We could use the graphical interface to make the games.  If we are feeling really ambitious we can try some simple AI as well, starting with something simple like TicTacToe and maybe something a bit more complicated, like a really really really stupid checkers player.
