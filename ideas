Games - Simple stuff like TicTacToe or Connect 4.  We could use the graphical interface to make the games.  If we are feeling really ambitious we can try some simple AI as well, starting with something simple like TicTacToe and maybe something a bit more complicated, like a really really really stupid checkers player.
This is basically what we≈ïe doing unless someone comes up with something genius really really soon.
